# MatPlotlib-Challenge

This Folder contain the matplotlib challenge, for certain it was a challenging work with lots of analysing and chart presentation work.

All the output are produce as they where describe as we did not have any sample ouput for the graph or the tables, I have tried my best to understand the description provide and solved the problem. Hope you go easy on the grading. 

The three observation are also included into the jupyter notebook in to the last cell.

Overall, It was a great challenge made me think a lot on the process of solving the problems but thanks to the hints about dividing the work and than solving it, that part really helped me reaching the final stage. Great learning the library function, now I am even more excited to do the next challenge and project.
